                    the main issue here is most likely that there are many people/organizations that pray on lonely and
                    desperate people. There needs to be some way to make every user equaly acountable for their actions
                    and reactions toward other users.</p>
                <p class="fs-6">In the swedish market there is a widely used authenticator called BankID
                    that uses social security numbers to verify the person who signs in to a service. If this could be
                    implemented the users would not swerve out in mean comments, and if there are other things going on
                    this would be
                    reported and connected to that specific person. </p>

                <p class="fs-6">The first thing wee need to implement is the way we sign in and create the user-profile.
                    A few simple steps with "this-or-that" questions followed by an optional comment about why that
                    choise was made. This will have a great impact while scrolling through the feed of several users.
                </p>
                <p class="fs-6">In this application there will be no images of the users shown at first. Just four
                    pictures representing the choisess we made earlier, this to keep it simple and fast to scroll. When
                    the user finds someone they simply start chatting, then they might find themselves to the point
                    where they would like to meet. Then they book a date through the app and 12 hours before the date
                    takes place they each recieve a picture of whom they will be meeting. And from the point they set
                    the date both are able to reschedule och cancel the date.</p>
                <p class="fs-6">By letting companys advertice in the app we remove the need for expensive memberships.
                    It's not as clean but I believe at this point that segregation comes at a higher cost.</p>

                    The comments tests have given to the design have been mostly positive while some are not too fond on
                    the advertisement. But while asked about the alternative as in memberships, they all aggreed with
                    me. This tells me that we are on the right track but could bennefit with more extensive testing.</p>
                <p class="fs-6">The first iteration of account-registration was designed as most competitors do,
                    questions about interests and this kind but this often falls in the background adn tend to be less
                    important. But with removing the image at the start lets this become more relevant and makes it so
                    that users get to know eachother more deeply before the first date. And by making it EAVEN easier
                    with a visual representation of the coise and the optional comment it was one of the positive thing
                    my testing noted.</p>
                <p class="fs-6">The last thing that the tests showed was to help the user even more by implementing some
                    sort of giud or vidoe to help understand why or what they were actually doing instead of hoping that
                    the users would like to experiment with it. And as a sidenote we maybe could make the events locally
                    and perhaps even more personal. Who knows we might even be able to put in some soet of advertising
                    further there.</p>
